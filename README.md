# ACCESS-AI

**Adaptive, Disability-Aware AI Interaction System**

This project aims to provide a unified interface for accessible interaction through three distinct modes:
1.  **Deaf-Mute Mode:** Sign Language Translation
2.  **Blind Mode:** Voice-First Navigation
3.  **Motor-Impaired Mode:** Head Gesture Control

## Structure
- `frontend/`: React + Vite application (The main interface)
- `backend/`: Node.js Express server with Gemini AI integration
- `database/`: SQLite database for translation history


## Getting Started
Navigate to `frontend/` to run the application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
